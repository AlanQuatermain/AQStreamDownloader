h2. Introduction

This is a simple class which will download anything arriving from a given NSInputStream (or CFReadStream, CFHTTPReadStreamRef, CFFTPStreamRef, etc.) to a file or to a block of memory. You can specify an output file path, or you can let the class choose one for you.

h3. Dependencies

The temp-file support in this class makes use of an NSFileManager class I wrote a while back, available as part of "AQToolkit":http://github.com/AlanQuatermain/AQToolkit. Look in the TempFiles folder for the relevant class, or replace with a simple NSTemporaryDirectory() wrapper of your own.
